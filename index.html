            Where Taste is Curated, <br />
            and Stories are Honoured
          </h1>
          <div class="">
            <p>
              At Casa Carigar, we believe every piece we select is a dialogue —
              between craft and curator, <br />
              past and present, form and feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
              We travel across India and beyond not merely to source furniture,
              but to listen: <br />to the story behind every chisel mark, every
              weave, every imperfect fingerprint that makes a creation human.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not follow trends. We shape taste. Our collection are
              reflection of a deep aesthetic and intuition — rooted in <br />
              India's artisanal legacy, yet unbound by borders. Every team is
              chosen not only for its beauty, but for the soul it carries

              We do not mass-produce, We do not compromis. <br />Our platform is

          <h1>Our Founders</h1>
          <div class="">
            <p>
              Casa Carigar was born from shared reverence for <br />
              craftsmanship, heritage, and enduring beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
              A family of aesthetes, collectors, and quite visionaries came
              <br />
              together to build a sanctuary for the world's finest makers.
            </p>
            <p>
              With roots in architecture, art, and legacy enterprises, the
              <br />
              founders sought to reimagine curation itself — not merely <br />
              selecting what is beautiful, but uplifting the hands and hearts
              behind it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The name "Carigar", meaning artisan, <br />
              is not incidental; it is our compass.
            </p>
            <p>
              A reminder that behind every piece lies a story, a soul, <br />
              and a maker whose work deserves to be celebrated, sustained, and
              seen.
